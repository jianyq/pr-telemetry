# Quick Start Guide

Get PR Telemetry up and running in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Python 3.11+ (for running the example)
- 8GB+ RAM available

## Step 1: Start Services (30 seconds)

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Wait for startup (check when ready)
curl http://localhost:8000/healthz
```

âœ… When you see `{"status": "healthy", ...}` you're ready!

## Step 2: Run Example (2 minutes)

```bash
# Install Python client library
pip install httpx

# Run the E2E example
python examples/submit_example.py
```

## What the Example Does

1. âœ… Creates a trace for fixing a buggy calculator
2. âœ… Uploads 10 events (edits, commands, tests, rationales)
3. âœ… Completes the trace
4. âœ… Triggers QA validation (runs tests in Docker)
5. âœ… Gets LLM judge scores

## Expected Output

```

## Step 3: Explore

### View in Browser

- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **MinIO Console**: http://localhost:9001 (admin/admin)

### Use the API

```bash
# Create a trace
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/traces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev_token_12345" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "participant_id": "user-123",
    "task_id": "task-456",
    "task_title": "Fix bug in function"
  }'

# Get a trace
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/traces/{trace_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev_token_12345"
```

### View Logs

```bash
# All logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Just API
docker-compose logs -f api

# Just worker
docker-compose logs -f worker
```

## Step 4: Stop When Done

```bash
# Stop services (keeps data)
docker-compose stop

# Or remove everything
docker-compose down -v
```

## Using Makefile (Optional)

If you have `make` installed:

```bash
make start    # Start services
make example  # Run example
make logs     # View logs
make clean    # Remove everything
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused"
Wait 30-60 seconds for services to fully start, then try again.

### "Port already in use"
Stop conflicting services or edit `docker-compose.yml` to use different ports.

### "Docker not found"
Install Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

### Example script fails
```bash
# Check API is running
curl http://localhost:8000/healthz

# Check logs
docker-compose logs api
```

## Next Steps

- Read the full [README.md](README.md) for architecture details
- Explore the [API documentation](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- Check the [example repo](examples/repo-buggy/) to understand the bug
- Review [example trace chunks](examples/sample-trace-chunks/)
- Integrate with your IDE workflow

## Need Help?

- Check [README.md](README.md) troubleshooting section
- View logs: `docker-compose logs`
- Open an issue on GitHub
